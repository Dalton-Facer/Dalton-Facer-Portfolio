## 3. Projects

### Camp Barnes Eagle Project
Scouting has played a crucial role in shaping the man I have become today, as much of my childhood was spent going on camping trips, completing Merit Badges, and into my early adult life, leading a Troop of other young adults whom I would inspire. The completion of my Eeagle Project, the fundraising and construction of a waterfront sign for Camp Barnes in Selbyville, DE, is an achievement I take much pride in.

My father was the Scoutmaster for most of the time I was in the scouting, and for alot of that time he would keep a hands-off approach. He would allow the boys to problem solve on their own and to justify their decisions whilst working out disputes. While I was working on my eagle project, he kept this approach. He gave suggestions but did not at any point take control of my project. It allowed me face the chalenge with my own two hands.

Through this experience, I gained valuable skills in advertising and fundraising, designing, promoting the project, assembling a team of volunteers, scheduling, and leading the construction process. I had began fundraising for this project around the time that COVID hit, which caused for price inflations and longer wait times. This was a big hurdle which delayed the project, but it was one that I would eventually break past.

    Project Totals

The project was in total around $4,900, all of which I did the promotion and fundraising for, including fundraising at local banks, collaborating with local businesses, and speaking in front of a nonprofit organization of local contractors, contractors for a cause.

### Delaware Tech Machined Compressed Air Engine

This project involved designing and machining a compressed air engine from scratch. I contributed by machining the air-piston cylinder and helping assemble the functional prototype. This required precision CNC and manual machining, technical drawings, and hands-on teamwork.

Once we constructed a working prototype, we made 13 more full assemblies. Each member of the team acquired an operational Air-Piston Cylinder.

### Delaware Tech Engineering Project: Drag Testing Lab Equipment
In my Engineering project class, we were assigned with designing drag testing equipment. The fluids lab was in need of a tool for demonstrating the coefficient of drag equation, so we developed a fluid loop powered by two electric thrusters.

In order to determine the coefficient of drag on an object, we need the density of the fluid, he reference area of the object, the force applied to the object, and the velocity of the fluid. With our design, we measure the force of drag on the object with a load cell, and can find the fluid velocity with the flow rate in the tubing.

This entire project needed to be waterproofed, transportable, and easy to operate, so we made sure to put the proper measures in place to ensure ease of use and maximal safety.

### Automated Pharmaceutical Packaging Line

I am currently attending University of Delaware and am working with a team of engineers to finalize the front station of a Pharmaceutical Packaging Line. It will automatically orient pill bottles upright, fill them with exactly 30 pills, weigh and reject the bottles with too many or too little pills, and transition the bottles to the back station.

This system will be fully operational in early may, and will ideally work consistently and fully-autonomously.
